Updating portfolio site:
	1. Multi-page format
		About page, doubles as the home page, include resume and social media links here
		Projects page, holds all projects, small summary on hover(?), 
			Search bar for projects or filtering system?
		Individual project page, one for each project
			Log format, topmost information is about latest version
			Reads like blog, older posts -> older versions
	2. Improve mobile
		About page should not have resume awkwardly placed at the end
		Projects page should have a small summary for each project
		Individual Project page follows same format as for desktop
	3. Background graphic, using canvas(?)
	4. Header
		Should it remain fixed or not(?)
	5. logo(?)

		What if we removed the side bar completely.
		Or, take Owlsketch section and put to top left
		and then About, Projects, Art with search bar
		across the top right

		Keep side bar, three sections: About, Projects, Art
		Each section has two preview images
		Selection on which current page is about is indicated somehow
