TODO:
1) Parallax scrolling that is mostly vertical movement, slight horizontal mvmnt
2) //Gibran Garcia. Artsy Programmer. JS scrolling thingy
3) nav bar will have collapsable menus as so:
	About:
		-Contact
		-Resume
	Projects:
		-//img
		-//img
		-//img
	Art
		-photography
		-drawings and paintings
	Work
		-Websites
4) Everything will be on one page, in the order presented by nav bar. Need
	a divider between content.
5) Since the project preview takes up a lot of space, have a sort of scrollable
	window, whose topmost project is the one being currently displayed on the
	right. Have arrows at the top and bottom to scroll through them.
	**Should have a selected indicator on current project
	**Play webm video on hover maybe...
6) Article div should be wider.
