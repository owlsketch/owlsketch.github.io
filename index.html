<p> A 3D gallery straight in your browser. Made with WebGL/ThreeJS for HackNY Fall 2014. It currently obtains its paintings from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection Online and these paintings are freely available as they have no copyright. This is a special thanks to the Metropolitan for giving me the priviledge to see all these wonderful paintings in their museum.

<p> These are experiments with the purpose of trying to mix art with programming. It's an effort to create dynamic works that have both artistic properties and random data driven processes. These sketches may use experimental technology that aren't fully supported in some browsers. They were made with Canvas, HTML5, Javascript and good intentions.

<h2>3D models</h2>
<a class="link" href="https://github.com/owlsketch/blendify_me">[ View Repository ]</a>

<p> Over the years I have made a few 3D models. You are free to download and use them and they are under the MIT License. They were made in Blender 3D, and any printer friendly models are clearly indicated. If you do make something out of these, I'd love to see them! Share them with me at satimidus@gmail.com or tweet me @owlsketch.

<a class="link" href="https://github.com/owlsketch/sketch_beat">[ Source Code ]</a>

<p> This was my first visual project after hearing about creative coding through PBS on youtube. I used openFrameworks and C++ and made this in a few hours. It is an audio visualizer program that moves to the beat of the music it is playing. Made in January, 2014, again with good intentions. I plan on re-implementing this in webGL in order to allow portability and remove the OS specific restriction.
