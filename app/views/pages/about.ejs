        Hello! My name is Gibrán García.
        I like the idea of being able to wake
        up, decide that there is something 
        missing in the world, and having the 
        skills to make it a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017 I finished a degree in 
        Computer Science at Rutgers 
        University. Now I'm working with 
        <a href="https://onlinelearning.rutgers.edu/grid">
          GRID - Game Research and Immersive Design - 
        </a> 
        on their Pixel Wall project. Check 
        out my 
        <a href="#">
          resume 
        </a>
        if you’d like to 
        know more.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time you can find me 
        <a href="#">
          skateboarding
        </a> 
        or taking 
        <a href="#">
          photos.
        </a> 
      </p>
